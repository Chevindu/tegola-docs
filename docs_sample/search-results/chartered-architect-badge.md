# What is "Chartered Architect" Badge

We use "Chartered Architect" badge ( <span class="chartered-tag">Chartered Architect</span> ) to identify SLIA registered Chartered Architects.  
 
As per the Gazette Extraordinary of the Democratic Republic of Sri Lanka, No: 2041/18, dated October 17th 2017, a “Chartered Architect” shall be a person holding a valid corporate membership of the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects, who is eligible to register at Architects Registration Board (ARB) under the category of Chartered Architects. 
 
[Acquiring a "Chartered Architect" badge](/completing-profiles/applying-for-chartered-badge) is a manual process. Tegola.lk undertakes the responsibility when reviewing professional accounts and nominating them as chartered architects.  
 
So if our platform identifies professional profiles as Chartered Architects, they really are.
