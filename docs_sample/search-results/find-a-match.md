## Step 2 - Finding perfect match

All the services are divided into 3 major topics

Design and Remodeling - Services you need to start your projects
Home Improvement -  Services you need to make improvements to your project
Home Services - Services you need to keep maintaining your project

According to your project stage, click on one of the three topics explained above.

Then click on the services you wish to find SPs for.

Now you’ll get to see our profile results for the selected category.



## Step 3 - Using the filter section

In the filter section there are 2 major tabs as “Profiles” & “Projects”. In the “Profiles” tab, you can compare between profiles and pick the best fit while in the “Projects” tab, you get the opportunity to compare between previous projects of our SPs and make a good choice.

Profiles tab

Location
Insert your location to filter SPs by your location. Search results will show you our SPs who are from your district or city.

Experience (Years)
Use the slider input to select a year and you’ll get profiles with higher experience by years than input number. To be clear if you select No.4, then you’ll get SPs who have at least 4 years of experience in their profession.

Select SPs
Let's say you see “Professional” and “Company” here. That means both industry professionals and companies provide that service. So if you prefer to go with professionals, tick on “Professional” to get only professional’s accounts or you may tick on “Company” to get only the company profiles in search results.

Services
This breaks down the service category you selected in the drop down menu into sub services. By selecting one sub service, it gives you all the SPs who provide that exact service. This helps you to find SPs who provide the exact service you’ve been looking for.

Languages
This option filters the search results by SPs languages.
