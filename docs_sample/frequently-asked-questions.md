# Frequently asked questions

## Why is my map location not visible?

When creating your account it only takes the map location if and only if the check box below map location which states “Above map location is correct”, is clicked. Unless you’ll see a “You haven't set your map location yet or it is not publicly visible” test above the map location in profile view.

To fix this, click on the edit icon in the map view box in profile view, Make sure the green colour pin is pointed to your correct location. If not drag and drop it to the correct location. Use the plus and minus buttons at the bottom right corner to zoom in and out the map view. After precisely pointing your location, click on the “Update location” button and then click on the “Show location” button.

Now your location is publicly visible.
