If everything is fine, click on the “Verify Email” button. You’ll see a check mark (:material-check:) in front of your email address, if your email is verified.

## Step 5 - Contact Details

You can add your company address here. If the company has several branches, use the address of the head office in here. Also select the same location from the drop-down list. First select the district, then the city.

In the map view, drag and drop the green colour marker onto your office location. You can zoom in and out of the map using  ":material-plus:" and ":material-minus:" buttons in the bottom right corner of the map view.  After pinning the location correctly, click on the checkbox “Above pinned location is correct”. Your location is taken into Tegola system if (and only if) that checkbox is ticked. You can leave the checkbox unticked if you don’t wish to add your location to your company profile.

Then add your company branch locations(if any) using the drop down menu. First select the district and then select the city and click on the “+” icon to add it. You can add multiple branch locations in the same way. This is used when the search results are filtered according to the location of a client. The maximum number of branches depends on the plan selected.

Then add the company contact number. Input should be 10 numbers. Do not enter the phone number with the country cord (+94).

You can add a website link and your company social media links here. Add the full URL of the links as shown in the text boxes. Leave them empty if you will.

Once this step is done, click on “Next” to move on.

## Step 6 - Company Certifications

To add your company certifications, input the certificate name in the textbox that says “Type certification here” and click on the “:material-plus:” button to add it. You can add more than one certifications using the same method. Maximum number of certifications you can add depends on your company plan.

!!! attention
    System only reads the certificate data once you click on the “:material-plus:” button per each certificate.

If you are done adding company certifications, or if you do not want to add them, click on “Next” for the next step.

## Step 7 - Tell us who you are

If preferred, you can skip this step and fill it later after logging into your account. To skip, click on “Skip” without filling anything in text boxes.

### Cover statement

### Special facts

This is your space to mention company uniqueness. You can add a maximum of 8 special facts having 80 characters each. After filling, click on the “:material-plus:” button to add it, making the textbox empty for another input.

Click on “Next” once you complete this section.

## Step 8 - Select the services

In the beginning, you selected the categories which your company provides services. This step breaks the categories into subcategories.

Select all the services your company provides. If you selected the free plan, you can "Finish" the account setup journey; for a paid plan, you can “Continue to payment”.

## Step 9 - Payment details

Fill the payment details (of the person who makes the payment) in these fields. You can select either a monthly plan or annual plan for the subscription. 

Visa or MasterCard can be used to make the payment. Subscription charges will be auto incurred, unless you cancel it before the next subscription renewal date. 

If you have any promotion code, then write it in the promotion-code text box and click Apply. You’ll see a “Promotion code applied” message after successfully applying the code. The payment details will also be updated to reflect the promotion.

!!! attention
    Any promotion applied will only be valid for the first payment you make.

If everything looks well, click on “Checkout”. Then you’ll be directed to the payment-gateway, powered by PayHere. Enter the required details to complete the payment.

After completing the payment, you’ll see a “CONGRATULATIONS” page. At this point, you are done creating your account. :tada:

You can login by clicking on “Log in to your account” action. Enter your account credentials and click “Sign in”.
