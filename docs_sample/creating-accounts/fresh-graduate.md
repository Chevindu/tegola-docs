You can zoom in and out of the map using ":material-plus:" and ":material-minus:" buttons in the bottom right corner of the map view. After pinning the location correctly, click on the checkbox “Above pinned location is correct”. Your location is taken into Tegola system if (and only if) that checkbox is ticked. You can leave the checkbox unticked if you don’t wish to add your location to your profile.

Then, select your working area from the drop-down menu. First select the district, and then the city. This is used to identify you, when search results are filtered by location.

Then add your phone number. Input length should be 10 digits. Please enter your phone number without the country code (+94).

You can add more than one qualification, following the same procedure. A maximum of 10 qualifications can be added.

    When adding qualifications, Tegola system only reads your data once you click on the “:material-plus:” button. If you fill up the details regarding your qualification but do not click on “:material-plus:” to add them, you information will not be saved.

You may add any other qualifications apart from degree(s) under “Other qualifications" section. Maximum is 15 qualifications.

Leave the qualification textboxes empty if you don’t want to add your qualifications.
